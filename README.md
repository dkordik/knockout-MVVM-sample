Knockout.js is a cool library, but like many things in the JS world, it's very open ended in how you can use it. This is my attempt to create a strict implementation of an MVVM framework using Knockout.


`js/app.js` and `js/framework.js` are the main portions of this experiment.


`js/app.js` - A test implementation of the framework
`js/framework.js` - The framework code

Comments/suggestions welcome.
